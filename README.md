# PIC16F_MPU6050
this is a code sample in purpose to use the MPU6050 to handle the angle of a plank mounted on 2 statuators
Be careful, i had one I2C slave (PIC microcontroleur) for each actuator so you might not need evrything i have coded especially the I2C part.
I hope it will be useful for you !
